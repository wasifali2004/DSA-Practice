# DSA-Practice
Welcome to the Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) Practice Problems repository! This repository is designed to help you improve your understanding of fundamental data structures and algorithms through a collection of curated practice problems. Each problem is accompanied by a detailed explanation, sample input/output, and a step-by-step solution.
Introduction
This repository contains a wide range of practice problems that cover various data structures and algorithms. Whether you are preparing for coding interviews, competitive programming, or simply want to strengthen your DSA knowledge, this repository has something for everyone.

Prerequisites
Before diving into the problems, it is recommended that you have a basic understanding of the following programming concepts:

Variables and Data Types
Control Structures (if-else, loops)
Functions and Recursion
Basic knowledge of C++, Python, or any other programming language
